# Secret Santa

## Installation

* Clone [this](https://github.com/RoOLeary/GiltChallenge.git) repo

Run `npm install` to install the project assets and dependencies. 
Run `gulp` to compile all of the things, and the browser will spin up.

In a real-world app, all the users and pairs wouldn't be shown to one another like this, also there'd likely to be signup functionality for additional people, but  altering the users.json is/was out of scope.


GILT Front End Coding Challenge
===============================

**Recommended time to invest**: 2 hrs

Guidelines
----------
* Use whichever libraries you prefer, or deem suitable for coding/styling purposes. Using libraries linked from public CDNs is preferable (e.g. [cdnjs.com](https://cdnjs.com/)).
* The solution will be expected to work via one of the following protocols: http, https.
* Gilt supports all major browsers from IE8 and up. If you have the time to also support these this is a bonus. Please specify which browsers you have aimed to support with your solution.

The Challenge
-------------
* Develop a web UI that loads the contents of users.json and renders a list of random assignments for [Secret Santa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Santa)
* Extra interactivity/styling will be considered a bonus.
* Use the included index.html and user.json to begin with but do not modify the structure of the users.json. You are free to modify index.html as you wish.
